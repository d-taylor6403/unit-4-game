# Crystal Collector Game


This is the fourth assignment for the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp.

The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate the knowledge necessary to create an interactive game for web browsers using jQuery to dynamically update the HTML.

---------------------------

#### Game Instructions: 

You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to a random number generated at the start of the game. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

Each time when the game starts, the value of the crystals will change.
